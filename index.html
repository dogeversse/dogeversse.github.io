            <p>
              <a href="https://dogeversse.github.io/"> Dogeverse </a>
              is in the final stage of one of the biggest presales of 2024 after
              raising more than $15 million for its $DOGEVERSE token. The
              presale is set to end in less than 7 days, or even sooner if the
              project sells out its $17 million hard cap.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dogeverse’s multi-chain status has been the key factor behind its
              early demand. As previously mentioned, the meme coin will launch
              on DEXs and CEXs in 6 different blockchain ecosystems, including
              Ethereum, Solana, BNB Smart Chain, Base, Avalanche and Polygon.
            </p>

            <p>
              Investors appear to be excited about this strategy, considering it
              bodes well for the token’s brand awareness and adoption after its
              launch.
            </p>

            <p>
              The project has also launched a Dogeverse Bridge using wormhole
              technology, which allows holders to transfer their tokens from one
              chain to another. This allows them to benefit from the best
              features of each blockchain, such as Solana’s low trading fees and
              Ethereum’s staking rewards.
            </p>

            <h2>Dogeverse price prediction for 2024</h2>
            <p>
              Dogeverse is slated to close its presale and launch on DEXs across
              6 blockchains on June 3. Considering the excitement around the
              presale, we think $DOGEVERSE could explode more than 10x at
              launch. Many crypto analysts and influencers agree, with one—Jacob
              ‘Crypto’ Bury—predicting that Dogeverse could even rocket 100x
              after launch.
